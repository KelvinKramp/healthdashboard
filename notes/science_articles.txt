Participants in SR demonstrated strong agreement compared to Holter monitoring (bias <1 beat, limits of agreement [LoA] −11 to 11 beats). In AF, both devices underestimated HR measurements (bias −9 beats, LoA −41 to 23). The degree of underestimation was more pronounced when HR > 100 bpm (bias of −28 beats for HR range 100–120 bpm, −48 for 120–140 bpm, and −69 for >140 bpm) compared to a slower HR (bias of −6 for HR range 80–100 bpm, <1 for 60–80 bpm, and −1 for <60 bpm).

In this validation study, the detection precision of AF and measurement accuracy during AF were both better with Apple Watch W mode than with FBT.
